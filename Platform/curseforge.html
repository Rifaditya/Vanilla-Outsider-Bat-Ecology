<p><strong>Bat Ecology</strong> gives the bat a purpose. No longer just ambient noise, bats are now a functioning society with behaviors, cycles, and farming utility.</p>

<h2>🌙 Features</h2>

<h3>1. Dynamic Roosting</h3>
<p>Bats adhere to a strict day/night cycle. During the day, they find a dark ceiling and sleep (hanging upside down). This isn't just visual—it completely shuts down their AI, saving server performance.</p>

<h3>2. Swarm Intelligence</h3>
<p>Bats are social. They form colonies with a specific <strong>Leader</strong>. Where the Leader goes, the pack follows. This creates beautiful, fluid flocking patterns instead of chaotic random movement.</p>

<h3>3. Farming Utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Guano:</strong> Passive drops while bats fly. Weak fertilizer.</li>
  <li><strong>Pollination:</strong> Use a <strong>Lantern</strong> to attract a swarm at night. As they orbit the light, they trigger a <strong>Pollination Burst</strong>, bonemealing crops in a 9x9 radius.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔧 Technical Notes</h2>
<p>Designed with the <em>"1KB Haiku"</em> philosophy (Zero-Overhead). This mod uses Mixins on the vanilla Bat entity. It adds no new entities to your save file.</p>
