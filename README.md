**Bat Ecology** transforms the Minecraft bat from a useless ambient particle into a complex, integrated part of the ecosystem. It introduces day/night roosting cycles, swarm intelligence, and a purpose for their existence: farming utility via Guano and Pollination.

## 🌙 Features

### 🦇 Behavior Overhaul

- **Roosting (Day)**: Bats sleep during the day, hanging in caves or under overhangs to save server performance (0 tick impact).
- **Hunting (Night)**: At dusk, colonies wake and take to the sky.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Bats move as a fluid flock. A designated Leader scans for Lanterns, and the colony follows.

### 🌱 Farming Utility

- **Guano**: Bats flying in the wild will occasionally drop **Guano**, which acts as weak Bone Meal.
- **Pollination**: Attract a swarm with a **Lantern**. When they orbit the light, they release a **Pollination Burst**, bone-mealing all crops in a 9x9 area.

### 🔊 Immersive Audio

- Bats use echolocation (pitch-shifted squeaks) when isolated to find their colony.
- Distinct sounds for roosting, waking, and panicking.

## 🔧 Installation
