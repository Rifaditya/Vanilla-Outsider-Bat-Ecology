**Bat Ecology** transforms the useless vanilla bat into a swarm-based, crop-dusting pollinator that integrates with the **Dasik Library** social system.

## ✨ Features

- **Swarming**: Bats form cohesive flocks with elected Leaders.
- **Pollination**: Bats orbit Lanterns at night, dusting nearby crops with Bonemeal effects.
- **Guano**: Ambient fertilizer drops.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Colony size affects bat size and flight patterns.
